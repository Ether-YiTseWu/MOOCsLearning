# Machine Learning
The machine learning course, made by a Stanford professor, Andrew Ng, is well-known. Three million students have enrolled it on Coursera platform. In addition, I type the key word on website, "machine learning Andrew Ng", there are a lot of positive criticisms. Many netizens recommend this course for ML beginners because it's easy to understand
